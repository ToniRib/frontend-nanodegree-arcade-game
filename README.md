Save the Kitties!
===============================

### Main Objective

Get all 5 kitties to their correct colored blocks at the top of the screen.

### How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move Cat Girl around the board
- Pick up each kitty and move it to the correct colored block
- Watch out for the bug enemies! If you hit one of these, you'll lose a life and both Cat Girl and the kitty will reset
-- You can also lose a life by putting a kitty on the wrong colored block or by stepping in the water
